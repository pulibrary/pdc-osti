The foci of the study are the investigation of differences between uniform and non-uniform modes of the discharges and the difference in production of OH and H2O2 Nanosecond-time scale imaging of the discharge shows transition from streamer to diffuse mode when applied electric field to the discharge gap approaches \u223c90 kV cm\u22121. The results show that both OH production in the gas phase and downstream H2O2 delivery rates to liquid depend on the discharge mode operation and are respectively 30% and 3 times higher for the non-uniform DBD compared to the diffuse discharge.",

        "abstract": "Stellarators offer a promising path towards fusion reactors, but their design and construction are complicated by stringent tolerance requirements on highly complex 3D coils. A potential way to simplify the engineering requirements for stellarators is to use simple planar toroidal field coils along with permanent magnet arrays to generate shaping fields. In order to ensure sufficient field accuracy while minimizing engineering complexity and system cost, new techniques are required to correct the field produced by the permanent magnet arrays to within requirements set by plasma physics. This work describes a novel correction method developed for this purpose. This analysis is applied to the design of a quasi-axisymmetric stellarator that employs a combination of permanent magnets and planar toroidal field coils to generate its magnetic field. Analysis techniques and initial results using the method for error correction on a proposed permanent magnet stellarator are shown, and it is demonstrated that the method successfully meets the design requirements of the project.\r\n\r\nThese files provide the data to reproduce plots for \"A novel scheme for error field correction in permanent magnet stellarators\"",

        "abstract": "Plasma shaping may have a stronger effect on global turbulence in tight-aspect-ratio tokamaks than in conventional-aspect-ratio tokamaks due to the higher toroidicity and more acute poloidal asymmetry in the magnetic field. In addition, previous local gyrokinetic studies have shown that it is necessary to include parallel magnetic field perturbations in order to accurately compute growth rates of electromagnetic modes in tight-aspect-ratio tokamaks. In this work, the effects of elongation and triangularity on global, ion-scale, linear electromagnetic modes are studied at NSTX aspect ratio and high plasma beta using the global gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code XGC. The effects of compressional magnetic perturbations are approximated via a well-known modification to the particle drifts that was developed for flux-tube simulations [N. Joiner et al., Phys. Plasmas 17, 072104 (2010)], without proof of its validity in a global simulation. Magnetic equilibria are re-constructed for each distinct plasma profile that is used. Coulomb collision effects are not considered. Within the limitations imposed by the present study, it is found that linear growth rates of electromagnetic modes (collisionless microtearing modes and kinetic ballooning modes) are significantly reduced by NSTX-like shaping. For example, growth rates of kinetic ballooning modes at high beta are reduced to the level of that of collisionless trapped electron modes.",

In this work, a fixed-boundary stellarator equilibrium was re-optimized for\r\nenergetic particle confinement via a two-step process: first, by minimizing deviations from quasi-axisymmetry (QA) on a single flux surface near the mid-radius, and secondly by maintaining this improved quasi-axisymmetry while minimizing the analytical quantity \u0393C , which represents the angle between magnetic flux surfaces and contours of J||, the second adiabatic invariant.This was performed multiple times, resulting in a group of equilibria with significantly reduced energetic particle losses, as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations of alpha particles in scaled-up versions of the equilibria. This is the first time that energetic particle losses in a QA stellarator have successfully been reduced by optimizing \u0393C . The relationship between energetic particle losses and metrics such as QA error (Eqa) and \u0393C in this set of equilibria were examined via statistical methods and a nearly linear relationship between volume-averaged \u0393C and prompt particle losses was found.\r\n\r\nData for all figures in \"Energetic particle optimization of quasi-axisymmetric stellarator equilibria\" by LeViness et al., accepted by Nuclear Fusion 2022.",

        "abstract": "In state-of-the-art stellarators, turbulence is a major cause of the degradation of plasma confinement. To maximize confinement, which eventually determines the amount of nuclear fusion reactions, turbulent transport needs to be reduced. Here we report the observation of a confinement regime in a stellarator plasma that is characterized by increased confinement and reduced turbulent fluctuations. The transition to this regime is driven by the injection of submillimetric boron powder grains into the plasma. With the line-averaged electron density being kept constant, we observe a substantial increase of stored energy and electron and ion temperatures. At the same time, the amplitude of the plasma turbulent fluctuations is halved. While lower frequency fluctuations are damped, higher frequency modes in the range between 100 and 200\u2009kHz are excited. We have observed this regime for different heating schemes, namely with both electron and ion cyclotron resonant radio frequencies and neutral beams, for both directions of the magnetic field and both hydrogen and deuterium plasmas.",

        "abstract": "Fusion could be a part of future decarbonized electricity systems, but it will need to compete with other technologies. In particular, pulsed tokamaks plants have a unique operational mode, and evaluating which characteristics make them economically competitive can help select between design pathways. Using a capacity expansion and operations model, we determined cost thresholds for pulsed tokamaks to reach a range of penetration levels in a future decarbonized US Eastern Interconnection. The required capital cost to reach a fusion capacity of 100 GW varied from $3000 to $7200/kW, and the equilibrium penetration increases rapidly with decreasing cost. The value per unit power capacity depends on the variable operational cost and on cost of its competition, particularly fission, much more than on the pulse cycle parameters. These findings can therefore provide initial cost targets for fusion more generally in the United States.",

        "abstract": "The simplified delta-f mixed-variable/pull-back electromagnetic simulation algorithm implemented in XGC for core plasma simulations by Cole et al. [Phys. Plasmas 28, 034501 (2021)] has been generalized to a total-f electromagnetic algorithm that can include, for the first time, the boundary plasma in diverted magnetic geometry with neutral particle recycling, turbulence and neoclassical physics. The delta-f mixed-variable/pull-back electromagnetic implementation is based on the pioneering work by Kleiber and Mischenko et al. [Kleiber et al., Phys. Plasmas 23, 032501 (2016); Mishchenko et al., Comput. Phys. Commun. 238, 194 (2019)]. An electromagnetic demonstration simulation is performed in a DIII-D-like, H-mode boundary plasma, including a corresponding comparative electrostatic simulation, which confirms that the electromagnetic simulation is necessary for a higher fidelity understanding of the electron particle and heat transport even at the low-beta pedestal foot in the vicinity of the magnetic separatrix..\r\n\r\nThis data set includes the data visualized in figures 2-7 in Electromagnetic total-f algorithm for gyrokinetic particle-in-cell simulations of boundary plasma in XGC Physics of Plasmas 29, 112308 (2022); https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0097855.

Phys.18 350\u201356). In this article, we report in more detail the experimental observations of increased plasma temperature and the decrease of turbulent fluctuations across the plasma cross section, on an extended database. In particular, we compare powders of different materials (B, C, BN), finding similar temperature improvement and turbulence response for the three cases. Modeling of the powder penetration into the plasma and of neoclassical electric field and fluxes support the interpretation of the experimental results. Additionally, we report evidence of the temperature improvement increasing with powder injection rates and decreasing for both increasing density and heating power. Though, plasma turbulence response varies depending on the initial conditions of the plasma, making it difficult to draw an inclusive description of the phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "Fusion power output from spherical tokamaks would benefit from increased confined plasma density, but there exists a limit on the density before confinement is lost and the plasma current is disrupted. This density limit has long been characterized by a simple, global Greenwald limit proportional to the plasma current and inversely proportional to the cross sectional area of the plasma. It is shown that in the database of discharges from the NSTX and MAST spherical tokamaks, the likelihood of disruption does increase above the Greenwald limit, and especially in the plasma current rampdown phase. The physics of the density limit has been recently theoretically explored through local criteria. Several of these are tested using the disruption event characterization and forecasting (DECAFTM) code for their potential effectiveness as disruption warning signals. For a limited set of NSTX discharges, a local island power balance criteria was found to be less reliable, presently, than the Greenwald limit. An empirical critical edge line density and a boundary turbulent transport limit were both tested for MAST-U, which has an electron density profile measurement with high spatial resolution in the outer part of the plasma. Both were found to have similar dependencies on key plasma parameters. In a limited set of MAST-U discharges that appear to disrupt due to rising density at values under the Greenwald limit, crossing of the boundary turbulent transport limit occurred close to the time of disruption. Finally, these limits were evaluated for their potential use in real-time, and it was found that with the necessary real-time inputs and with refinement through further testing, these limits could be implemented in a real-time disruption forecasting system.",

        "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are some of the most energetic and violent events in our solar system. The prediction and understanding of CMEs is of particular importance due to the impact that they can have on Earth-based satellite systems, and in extreme cases, ground-based electronics. CMEs often occur when long-lived magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) anchored to the solar surface destabilize and erupt away from the Sun. One potential cause for these eruptions is an ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instability such as the kink or torus instability. Previous experiments on the Magnetic Reconnection eXperiment (MRX) revealed a class of MFRs that were torus-unstable but kink-stable, which failed to erupt. These \u201cfailed-tori\u201d went through a process similar to Taylor relaxation where the toroidal current was redistributed before the eruption ultimately failed. We have investigated this behavior through additional diagnostics that measure the current distribution at the foot points and the energy distribution before and after an event. These measurements indicate that ideal MHD effects are sufficient to explain the energy distribution changes during failed torus events. This excludes Taylor relaxation as a possible mechanism of current redistribution during an event. A new model that only requires non-ideal effects in a thin layer above the electrodes is presented to explain the observed phenomena. This work broadens our understanding of the stability of MFRs and the mechanism behind the failed torus through the improved prediction of the torus instability and through new diagnostics to measure the energy inventory and current profile at the foot points.",

        "abstract": "We present a new neoclassical transport model for large aspect ratio tokamaks where the gradient scale lengths are of the size of the ion poloidal gyroradius. Previous work on neoclassical transport across transport barriers assumed large density and potential gradients but a small temperature gradient, or neglected the gradient of the mean parallel flow. Using large aspect ratio and low collisionality expansions, we relax these restrictive assumptions. We define a new set of variables based on conserved quantities, which simplifies the drift kinetic equation whilst keeping strong gradients, and derive equations describing the transport of particles, parallel momentum and energy by ions in the banana regime. The poloidally varying parts of density and electric potential are included. Studying contributions from both passing and trapped particles, we show that the resulting transport is dominated by trapped particles. We find that a non-zero neoclassical particle flux requires parallel momentum input which could be provided through interaction with turbulence or impurities. We derive upper and lower bounds for the energy flux across a transport barrier in both temperature and density and present example profiles and fluxes.",

        "abstract": "The MAST-U fusion plasma research device, the upgrade to the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak, has recently completed its first campaign of physics operation. MAST-U operated with Ohmic, or one or two neutral beams for heating, at 400-800 kA plasma current, in conventional or \u201cSuperX\u201d divertor configurations. Equilibrium reconstructions provide key plasma physics parameters vs. time for each discharge, and diagrams are produced which show where the prevalence of operation occurred as well as the limits in various operational spaces. When compared to stability limits, the operation of MAST-U so far has generally stayed out of the low q, low density instability region, and below the high density Greenwald limit, high beta global stability limits, and high elongation vertical stability limit. MAST-U still has the potential to reach higher elongation, which could benefit the plasma performance. Despite the majority of operation happening below established stability limits, disruptions did occur in the flat-top phase of MAST-U plasmas. The reasons for these disruptions are highlighted, and possible strategies to avoid them and to extend the operational space of MAST-U in future campaigns are discussed.\r\n\r\nThe data for reproducing each figure is included here. For Figures 1-7 and 9b, the \"x\" and \"y\" data gives the center of the squares of the contour plots (labeled, with units, inside each file). The \"z\" data gives the Log10 of the number of equilibria in each square (for 9b the average amplitude of the FFT). For Figures 8, 9a, and 10, the data given are the time series of the various quantities plotted, which are labelled, with units, inside each file.",

        "abstract": "Ion orbit loss has been used to model the formation of a strong negative radial electric field Er in the tokamak edge, as well as edge momentum transport and toroidal rotation. To quantitatively measure ion orbit loss, an orbit-flux formulation has been developed and numerically applied to the gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code XGC. We study collisional ion orbit loss in an axisymmetric DIII-D L-mode plasma using gyrokinetic ions and drift-kinetic electrons. Numerical simulations, where the plasma density and temperature profiles are maintained through neutral ionization and heating, show the formation of a quasisteady negative Er in the edge. We have measured a radially outgoing ion gyrocenter flux due to collisional scattering of ions into the loss orbits, which is balanced by the radially incoming ion gyrocenter flux from confined orbits on the collisional time scale. This suggests that collisional ion orbit loss can shift Er in the negative direction compared to that in plasmas without orbit loss. It is also found that collisional ion orbit loss can contribute to a radially outgoing (counter-current) toroidal-angular-momentum flux, which is not balanced by the toroidal-angular-momentum flux carried by ions on the confined orbits. Therefore, the edge toroidal rotation shifts in the co-current direction on the collisional time scale.",

        "abstract": "The dynamic interplay between the core and the edge plasma has important consequences in the confinement and heating of fusion plasma. The transport of the Scrape-Off-Layer (SOL) plasma imposes boundary conditions on the core plasma, and neutral transport through the SOL influences the core plasma sourcing. In order to better study these effects in a self-consistent, time-dependent fashion with reasonable turn-around time, a reduced model is needed. In this paper we introduce the SOL Box Model, a reduced SOL model that calculates the plasma temperature and density in the SOL given the core-to-edge particle and power fluxes and recycling coefficients. The analytic nature of the Box Model allows one to readily incorporate SOL physics in time-dependent transport solvers for pulse design applications in the control room. Here we demonstrate such a coupling with the core transport solver TRANSP and compare the results with density and temperature measurements, obtained through Thomson scattering and Langmuir probes, of an NSTX discharge. Implications for future interpretive and predictive simulations are discussed.",
